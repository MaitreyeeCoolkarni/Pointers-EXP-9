# Pointers-EXP-9

## Aim:
To perform addition and subtraction of array elements using pointers in C++.

## Algorithm:

Start the program.

Declare and initialize an integer array with 5 elements: {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}.

Declare a pointer ptr and assign it the address of the 4th index element (arr[4]).

Declare another pointer ptr1 and assign it the address of the 2nd index element (arr[2]).

Dereference both pointers and perform addition: (*ptr) + (*ptr1).

Dereference both pointers and perform subtraction: (*ptr) - (*ptr1).

Display the results for addition and subtraction.

End the program.

## Conclusion:
The program successfully demonstrates the use of pointers to access array elements and perform arithmetic operations. By dereferencing pointers, the program retrieves the values stored in the array and computes their sum and difference correctly.
